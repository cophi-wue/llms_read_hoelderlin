# Bedeutung von (Teil-)Sätzen


Here we elicit interpretations of sentences or parts of sentences. We concentrate on those sentences, which have a non-obvious meaning. 'Meaning' doesn't refer here to an interpretation, but just to the question, what is the state of the fictional word described by the text. These experiments are related to the analysis of metaphorical expressions (cf. Notebook 07). 

## 1. Hälfte des Lebens (1804)

The basic structure of the poem is simple. The two stanzas, representing the two "halves of life," are arranged antithetically to each other. The antithetical structure is essentially supported by four phrases or parts of sentences, namely "das Land hänget in den See", "die holden Schwäne trunken“, "die Mauern stehn sprachlos" und "im Winde klirren die Fahnen". The summer stanza portrays a harmonious landscape where everything is interconnected and alive, while the winter stanza depicts a scene of separation, silence, and lifelessness (Schmidt).

**"Das Land hänget im See"** 

Using the phrase "Das Land hänget im See" as an example, this study aims to compare the techniques of zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting. Zero-shot prompting refers to using a prompt to interact with the model without providing any examples or demonstrations. The zero-shot prompt directly instructs the model to perform a task without additional examples to guide it. Conversely, few-shot prompting can be employed as a technique to enable in-context learning.

This experiment seeks to explore the insight provided by Liu et al.: "LLMs do not make use of the metaphorical context well, instead relying on the predicted probability of interpretations alone [...]" (2022, p. 4438).


```python
prompt = f"""We want to understand the following poem: 

{poem_1.text}

What are possible meanings of the phrase 'Das Land hänget in den See'? Describe in each case exactly what kind of landscape this phrase renders.
"""

print(prompt)
```

Expected answer:

at least three interpretations have been discussed:
* parts of the trees and bushes are extending  over the water
* there is a small peninsula (the image is basically the view from above)
* the land with its pear tree and roses is mirrored by the water

**"Die Mauern stehn sprachlos"**

Using the phrase 'The walls stand speechless and cold,' we investigate how different models complete clauses with the suffix 'that is to say.' (The completion function might also be measured with various temperatures: 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.)

In a first step, the models generate a completion of the sentence without the context of the poem 'Half of Life.' In the second step, the models should choose which completion fits best in the context of the poem. The output should then be ranked.

Of particular interest for us: 
By analyzing completions generated by different models, we might gain a comprehensive understanding of each model's creativity, coherence and contextual understanding.
Do the models each select their "own" completion?

Prompt design:
- Generate completions (without refering to the poem), experiments with different temperatures
- Each model chooses the "best" completions for the context of the poem
- Ranking completions)
  
Expected answers (Schmidt): 
- Within the speechless walls, the nature remains silent towards the lyrical I, which was once entirely language (a whole)
- the mute 'mechanical course' of facts => through and with nature God/the divinity speaks



```python
prompt = f"""Complete the following phrase 'The walls stand speechless and cold that is to say...' with a maximum length of 50 tokens.

**"im Winde klirren die Fahnen"**

To analyze how different llms might interpret the phrase "im Winde klirren die Fahnen" based on the ambiguity of the word "Fahne" in German and English, we explore the various meanings provided and consider the contexts in which each might be used. 

Meanings of "Fahne" (Duden)
- Alkoholfahne (informal): Alcohol breath
- Printing (Druckwesen): Proof copy of a text not yet formatted into pages
- Hunting (Jägersprache): Long hair on the tails of certain hunting dogs and squirrels
- Zoology (Zoologie): Part of a bird's feather consisting of barbs on either side of the shaft
- Botany (Botanik): The uppermost petal of a butterfly flower
- Military: Service in the National People's Army of the GDR, historical use To call to arms (veraltet)

Meanings of flag (Oxford Learners Dictionaries)
- a piece of cloth with a special coloured design on it that may be the symbol of a particular country organization, may be used to give a signal or may have a particular meaning. A flag can be attached to a pole (= a long thin straight piece of wood or metal) or held in the hand.
- used to refer to a particular country or organization and its beliefs and values
- (verb) [transitive] flag something to draw attention to information that you think is important, especially by putting a special mark next to it
- (verb) [intransitive] to become tired, weaker or less enthusiastic

Prompt design
- zero-shot prompting (no context is given)
- few-shot prompting (minimal and rich context information: right and wrong context information, e.g. Add a paragraph describing a scene, such as a military parade or a hunting expedition.

Expected answers: 
- flags as weathercocks that move in the wind
- the speechlessness is interrupted by the clanging of the flags, the clanging stands for the "machine gait" of the world, and instead of the language of blossom, fruit and living being, the metal twisted by the wind sounds

## Unsere Toten (1922)

**"die Füße mühn sich im zitternden Mondenschein"**

The hypothesis proposed by Liu et al. (2022), which asserts that the task of associating non-figurative language with its interpretation is more challenging than the reverse, will be tested using the phrase "die Füße mühn sich im zitternden Mondenschein". 

Interpretations: 
1.  A sense of effort or struggle illuminated by the unsteady light of the moon, perhaps hinting at a journey or hard work during the night.
2.  The phrase conveys an idea of toil and perseverance despite uncertain, ever-changing circumstances, symbolized by the trembling moonlight. The feet continue their arduous journey under the unsteady light of the moon.

Of particular interest:
- Can LLM generate figurative phrases based on paraphrases or interpretations?

Prompt design
- generate a phrase with 5-10 words rephrasing or extracting the key message of this interpretation
- persona and situation modeling
- contextual understanding
- “forward” and “backward” probabilities assigned to interpretations and phrases, respectively.


```python
# Reverse interpretation and phrase
