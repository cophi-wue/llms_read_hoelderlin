Secondly, we wanted it to abstract these rules from given example data. The rules we define are simple. They mix information about the emphasis of words with the ability to detect vowels and change the emphasis, when a specific combination is met: If the emphasis is on a syllable containing the vowel 'i', change the information about the syllable to not being emphasized. All models couldn't solve this task. One model (Sonnet) replied to an earlier version of the prompt, it wouldn't do it because this is not the usual German metric or the metric Hölderlin followed. Then we added the information that this is a research project. Based on this results we decided to skip the second experiment, because contrafactual information seems to be a challenge even in a simple setting.\n"

The reason for this is: the poem uses free knittelverses. They have four stressed syllables but allow upbeats and free fillings. Vers 11 and 12 change their structure most prominently because they switch from the pattern unstressed syllable + a stressed syllabe at the end which is used throughout the poem to stressed + unstressed, a change which is emphasized by the fact that these are also rhyme words.
