The antithetical structure is essentially supported by four phrases or parts of sentences, namely \"das Land hänget in den See\", \"die holden Schwäne trunken“, \"die Mauern stehn sprachlos\" und \"im Winde klirren die Fahnen\". The summer stanza portrays a harmonious landscape where everything is interconnected and alive, while the winter stanza depicts a scene of separation, silence, and lifelessness (Schmidt).\n",
