Vers 11 and 12 change their structure most prominently because they switch from the pattern unstressed syllable + a stressed syllabe at the end which is used throughout the poem to stressed + unstressed, a change which is emphasized by the fact that these are also rhyme words.

There is not a lot of this happening in the first half, but in the second half, we see that 'wacht' and 'Nacht' belong somewhat to opposites, similarly 'schwer' (which recalls the 'müd' (tired)) and 'Begehr'. Finally the last rhyme 'zerfressen' (eaten away) and vergessen (forgotten) implies an even stronger semantic relation, but not of opposites, rather both imply that there has been something which is no getting lost in a painful process. \n",
    "2) The second looks at the vowels of the rhymes and connects them to the tone and mood of the poem. We cannot detect anything which would be the basis for an interesting and productive description. "

    "Since the results on the \"General knowledge\" level showed considerable weaknesses, we did not refer the results of the \"Expert knwoledge\" level in the paper. Nevertheless, it is instructive to force the models to perform more complex tasks. The task we designed was to provide an interpretation of the poem that tries to relate the words that are connected by assonance on the level of textual meaning by grouping and contrasting assonance-based semantic fields. Again, all models failed to correctly detect assonance. However, in cases with correct connection, surprisingly good hypotheses were raised – for instance by Gemini, which based its interpretation on the assonance claiming for the second stanza of Hölderlin's poem that \"the 'eː' sound links the speaker's lament (\"Weh mir\") with the absence of summer elements (\"nehm’,\" \"stehn\"). Though not an entirely precise analysis, the connection between lament and privation is reasonable.\n",
    "%(it would, of course, have been more precise to interpret the verb \"nehmen\" here as referring to the problem of compensating the privation of summer). \n",
    "Here we see that the models perform well at the seemingly more complex tasks of seeing non-trivial and latent semantic relations and even of combining different latent relations. Since the basic description of the sound characteristics of the poem lacks precision, further interpretive hypotheses on the level of expert knowledge have not yet become convincing, however."

    "All three models describe meaningful semantic fields and provide them with correct example words. The part of speech recognition is also mostly correct. While Gpt4o only gives examples of lexical parts of speech, Sonnet mentions the interjection \"weh\" and refers somewhat cryptical to \"interrogative construction\" instead of parts of speech. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini is relatively verbose and makes some faulty claims: The polysemous verb \"hängen\", which is used as intransitive verb describing a state in the poem, is incorrectly identified as (transitive) verb of action. The subordinating conjuntion \"wenn\" is incorrectly classified as interrogative pronoun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sonnet identifies a \"Sacred/transcendent field\" based on adjectives \"heilignüchtern\" and  \"hold\" that stand out because they are not part of everyday language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the models always name 3 semantic fields for each stanza, although this was not specified in the prompt. The only exception is Sonnet by listing 4 semantic fields for the second stanza.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sonnet answers somewhat taciturnly and doesn't quite follow the analysis sequence laid out in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt does not ask for the poem's author and title, yet Gpt4o and Gemini both generate this information. While GPTo4 does this correctly, \n",
    "Gemini incorrectly attributes the poem to Rilke. For GPTo4 this could mean that the poem itself and possibly some interpretations were seen in the training data."

The antithetical structure is essentially supported by four phrases or parts of sentences, namely \"das Land hänget in den See\", \"die holden Schwäne trunken“, \"die Mauern stehn sprachlos\" und \"im Winde klirren die Fahnen\". The summer stanza portrays a harmonious landscape where everything is interconnected and alive, while the winter stanza depicts a scene of separation, silence, and lifelessness (Schmidt).\n",

    "\n",
    "The title *\"Hälfte des Lebens\"* (Half of Life) suggests a reflection on the midpoint of a person's life, and in the poem, this idea of a halfway mark manifests in contrasting imagery and moods. The poem by Friedrich Hölderlin vividly captures the transition between two halves of existence—one filled with warmth, beauty, and life, the other marked by coldness, desolation, and silence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Half of Life:\n",
    "The first stanza is rich with images of abundance and vitality: yellow pears, wild roses, swans, and the serene lake. These symbols evoke the peak of life, which can be interpreted as youth or the prime years of adulthood. The swans, \"trunken von Küssen\" (drunk with kisses), dipping their heads into the water, express a kind of joy or immersion in life's pleasures. The lake, described as \"heilignüchternes Wasser\" (sacred, sober water), adds a layer of calm spirituality to this fullness of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can represent the first \"half\" of life, where everything is in bloom, imbued with sensual beauty and vitality. There is a sense of being immersed in the natural world, where everything is connected and flowing harmoniously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Half of Life:\n",
    "The second stanza shifts abruptly, embodying the speaker’s anxiety about the coming of winter, which can symbolize old age, death, or a period of emotional or spiritual barrenness. Here, the speaker laments the loss of flowers, sunshine, and shadows—things that signify life and its richness. Instead, there are walls, cold and silent, and flags clattering in the wind, suggesting a bleak, lifeless, and empty world.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stark contrast between the two stanzas can represent the second half of life, where vitality has drained away, leaving only the cold, desolate reminders of what once was. The walls are \"sprachlos und kalt\" (speechless and cold), symbolizing isolation and the absence of communication or warmth, much like how old age or a diminished existence can feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Half\" as Transition:\n",
    "The poem, then, uses \"Hälfte\" to mark not just an individual’s age in terms of a middle point, but more broadly, a shift in the forms of existence. The first half is aligned with life’s fullness—growth, beauty, and joy—while the second half is marked by decline, absence, and coldness. The transition from one half to the other could reflect a person's confrontation with mortality, the inevitability of loss, or the change from external vibrancy to internal reflection or isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The concept of \"Hälfte\" refers to both aspects of individual age and different modes of existence. It can symbolize a personal journey, where youth and age represent two contrasting periods of life. On a broader existential level, it can also point to the cyclical nature of life and the inevitable transition from fullness to emptiness. The poem is a meditation on the duality of existence, illustrating the fleeting nature of life's beauty and the somber inevitability of its decline.\n"

    "### Answer given by ChatGPT (in the browser)\n",
    "\n",
    "The title *\"Unsere Toten\"* (Our Dead) immediately suggests a collective connection to the deceased, creating a sense of shared loss or mourning. To fully interpret the title and its relationship to the poem, we must consider both the pronoun \"unser\" and the depiction of the dead in the verses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meaning of \"Unsere Toten\":\n",
    "The phrase \"Unsere Toten\" points to a group of dead who are significant to a specific collective. The possessive pronoun \"unser\" implies that these dead belong to \"us,\" suggesting a national, cultural, or social bond. The dead in the poem are not distant or abstract; they are the *shared* dead of the group to whom the speaker belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Journey of the Dead:\n",
    "The poem describes the weary movement of many feet—tired, wounded, and trudging through the night, deep into Germany. The imagery of \"Schleppen sich nächtens viele Füße müd\" (many feet drag themselves wearily at night) evokes a ghostly procession. These feet belong to those who have suffered, perhaps in war, exile, or hardship. The line \"Rastlos tief nach Deutschland hinein\" (restlessly deep into Germany) suggests that the dead are trying to return to their homeland.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dead carry a \"Klage\" (lament), described as full of \"wilder Begehr\" (wild desire), which underscores their deep yearning and pain. Their plea—\"Nur nicht vergessen! Uns nicht vergessen!\" (Just don't forget! Don't forget us!)—suggests that they feel forgotten, desiring remembrance from the living.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Unser\" Refers to a National or Cultural Group:\n",
    "Given the reference to \"Deutschland\" and the historical connotations of migration, war, and loss, \"unser\" likely refers to a national community, possibly the German people. The dead could represent those who perished during significant periods of conflict (such as wars), or perhaps those who were displaced, exiled, or suffered in foreign lands. The poem captures a sense of collective responsibility toward these dead, as the living are urged to remember them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who Are \"Our Dead\"?\n",
    "The dead referred to in the title are those connected to the community or nation of the speaker. These could be:\n",
    "- Soldiers who died in wars, particularly in contexts like World War I or II, who were unable to return home.\n",
    "- Civilians who perished during times of displacement, suffering, or exile.\n",
    "- Those who died in foreign lands, whose memories may be fading over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dead in the poem are thus a symbol of collective loss, and their restless, sorrowful march reflects their desire not to be forgotten by the living community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The title \"Unsere Toten\" refers to the dead who belong to a particular collective, most likely the German people. These dead might be soldiers, exiles, or victims of historical trauma. The poem reflects their plea for remembrance and recognition, emphasizing the shared responsibility of the living to honor and remember those who have passed. In this way, the poem addresses themes of memory, loss, and the consequences of forgetting those who have died."

    "The poem reveals key themes of isolation, purity, and existential yearning. The analysis highlights several layers of meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature as Refuge:\n",
    "Odd-syllable words like \"Landschaft,\" \"Natur,\" and \"unangetastet\" emphasize the speaker’s desire for a sanctuary in the natural world—one untouched by external interference. This underscores the motif of withdrawal and self-containment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paradox of Love and Isolation:\n",
    "The words \"maßlosen,\" \"ein,\" and \"eine\" highlight the tension between boundless emotional capacity and the inability to connect. This paradox is central to the speaker's journey, where love becomes both a source of meaning and an agent of isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timelessness and Despair:\n",
    "Words like \"auch\" and \"auf\" contribute to a tone of inevitability and timelessness. The \"verrostete Bank\" (rusted bench) symbolizes stasis and resignation, while the repetition of singular pronouns reflects the permanence of solitude.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nature as a Mirror of Solitude:\n",
    "The words \"Fichten\" and \"Moose\" evoke an unchanging natural world, which mirrors the speaker’s sense of stasis and isolation. The setting becomes a sanctuary where the speaker's sorrow is both reflected and held.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorrow as a Persistent Companion:\n",
    "The repetition of \"Klage\" (lament) and the presence of \"Frage\" (question) suggest an endless cycle of sorrow and yearning. Despite the lack of answers, the act of lamenting itself carries meaning and reflects the speaker’s resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Divine as Silent Witness:\n",
    "The speaker’s \"Weinen\" (crying) and hidden emotions are juxtaposed with their connection to God (\"deine Liebe Gott versteht\"). This relationship introduces a spiritual dimension to the speaker’s suffering, where even unspoken sorrow is acknowledged.\n",

    "Interpretation of the poem 1: \n",
    "The poem reveals key themes of isolation, purity, and existential yearning. The analysis highlights several layers of meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature as Refuge:\n",
    "Odd-syllable words like \"Landschaft,\" \"Natur,\" and \"unangetastet\" emphasize the speaker’s desire for a sanctuary in the natural world—one untouched by external interference. This underscores the motif of withdrawal and self-containment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paradox of Love and Isolation:\n",
    "The words \"maßlosen,\" \"ein,\" and \"eine\" highlight the tension between boundless emotional capacity and the inability to connect. This paradox is central to the speaker's journey, where love becomes both a source of meaning and an agent of isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timelessness and Despair:\n",
    "Words like \"auch\" and \"auf\" contribute to a tone of inevitability and timelessness. The \"verrostete Bank\" (rusted bench) symbolizes stasis and resignation, while the repetition of singular pronouns reflects the permanence of solitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poem 2:\n",
    "Nikolaus Lenau (1802–1850): Einsamkeit. (1834)\n",
    "Wild verwachsne dunkle Fichten,\n",
    "Leise klagt die Quelle fort;\n",
    "Herz, das ist der rechte Ort\n",
    "Für dein schmerzliches Verzichten!\n",
    "Grauer Vogel in den Zweigen!\n",
    "Einsam deine Klage singt,\n",
    "Und auf deine Frage bringt\n",
    "Antwort nicht des Waldes Schweigen.\n",
    "Wenn’s auch immer schweigen bliebe,\n",
    "Klage, klage fort; es weht,\n",
    "Der dich höret und versteht,\n",
    "Stille hier der Geist der Liebe.\n",
    "Nicht verloren hier im Moose,\n",
    "Herz, dein heimlich Weinen geht,\n",
    "Deine Liebe Gott versteht,\n",
    "Deine tiefe, hoffnungslose!\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreation of Poem 2:\n",
    "The poem creates a thematic pattern focused on the interplay between solitude, unanswered longing, and emotional expression within nature. Key interpretative insights include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature as a Mirror of Solitude:\n",
    "The words \"Fichten\" and \"Moose\" evoke an unchanging natural world, which mirrors the speaker’s sense of stasis and isolation. The setting becomes a sanctuary where the speaker's sorrow is both reflected and held.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorrow as a Persistent Companion:\n",
    "The repetition of \"Klage\" (lament) and the presence of \"Frage\" (question) suggest an endless cycle of sorrow and yearning. Despite the lack of answers, the act of lamenting itself carries meaning and reflects the speaker’s resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Divine as Silent Witness:\n",
    "The speaker’s \"Weinen\" (crying) and hidden emotions are juxtaposed with their connection to God (\"deine Liebe Gott versteht\"). This relationship introduces a spiritual dimension to the speaker’s suffering, where even unspoken sorrow is acknowledged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poem 3: \n",
    "\"Unsere Toten\"\n",
    "Von Westen und Osten, von Nord und Süd schleppen sich nächtens viele Füße müd, Füße, vom Wandern wund und zerfetzt, langsam bedächtig zur Erde gesetzt, müh'n sich im zitternden Mondenschein rastlos tief nach Deutschland hinein. Und wer mit lauschendem Ohr noch wacht hört sie in jedweder werdenden Nacht, hört dies Schlurfen so müde und schwer, hört eine Klage voll wilder Begehr, eine Klage schmerzzerfressen: nur nicht vergessen! Uns nicht vergessen!\n",

    "Interpretation from poem 1: \n",
    "Under this analytical rule, the poem is understood as a communicative act between the speaker and themselves or an imagined other, rather than a description of an external world. The expressions function to construct an internal landscape where themes of isolation, paradoxical love, and existential endurance are explored. The speaker builds symbolic spaces (house, bench) to house their emotional turmoil, creating a self-contained dialogue within a desolate yet meaningful internal world. This interpretation highlights the poem’s focus on the subjective function of language and its power to shape emotional reality.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretation from poem 2:\n",
    "The poem emerges as an exploration of solitude and sorrow, where the act of communication itself—through lament, introspection, and spiritual dialogue—becomes the primary source of meaning. The expressions function to externalize the speaker’s inner turmoil, transforming nature into a reflective space and God into an empathetic listener.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this analysis, the poem suggests that even in the absence of a response from the external world, the act of expressing sorrow has intrinsic value, as it connects the speaker to a spiritual dimension and validates their inner experience. This highlights the resilience of the human spirit in finding meaning through communication, even in the face of silence and hopelessness.\n",
